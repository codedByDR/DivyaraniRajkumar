# Hi, I'm Divya 👋  
Backend Developer | Aspiring Full‑Stack Engineer | Future AI/ML Specialist  

I’m a passionate software engineer with **3.5+ years of hands-on experience** building robust, scalable backend applications using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and modern cloud-first approaches.  
Over the last **6 months**, I’ve started growing into **Angular** and **TypeScript** to transition into a full‑stack development role.  

Since **2022**, I’ve been working at **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**, where I contribute to enterprise systems, distributed architectures, and cloud-based solutions.  
My long-term vision is to become a **Full‑Stack Developer** with strong expertise in **AI/ML**, **System Design**, and **cloud-native engineering**.
